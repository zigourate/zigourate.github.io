	<p>Your child must be at least 1 year old and will have a two week trial period during which both parties, the parents and the childcare service center, will decide if Montreal Kindergarten is a good fit for the child. We accept children on a first come, first serve basis, but we prioritize siblings of children already in the childcare center.There is a onetime non-refundable registration fee of $50.00 payable at the time of registration before the two week trial period. We also ask that you provide us with a copy of your child’s immunization record.</p>
	<p>We will provide you with a registration package that includes all the forms you need to fill out at our initial meeting. This will include a Registration Form (with specific questions about your child, i.e. temperament, favorite thing etc. as well as your emergency contacts), an Emergency Medical Consent Form, two Medication Forms, and the contract. You can also go to “Forms &amp; Documents” under the “Parents” section to have access to all the forms. These forms will need to be completed prior to your child start date, except for the contract that will be needed after the two week trial period has ended. Please note that a spot is not guaranteed until the contract is returned and signed.</p>
