	<h4>Payment Policy</h4>
	<p>Payments for full-time and part-time children are made in advance and are due in full on the 1st of each month. Payments for evening, weekend, or occasional care are due at the drop-off time. We accept cash, checks, Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT), money orders or post-dated checks (made out to Maison Kinder). There is a $35 charge for checks returned as NSF. If more than two checks are returned unpaid, only cash will be accepted from then on. Montreal Kindergarten reserves the right to cancel if payments are not made on time and in full.</p>
	<p>Fees are paid during all absences; once a space is confirmed, it is payable whether the child attends or not since Montreal Kindergarten operates on a flat-fee basis. When you sign a contract, you are contracting for a spot and not actual hours used. This means that you will pay for your childâ€™s regularly scheduled attendance, whether they are here or not. This includes absences for vacation, illness, snow days, power outage, holidays, or other reason.</p>
	<p>We provide parents who are late picking up their children with a 10 minute grace period. After the grace period, there are late charges, $10 per 15 minutes. Please note that there will also be late charges in the eventuality of bad weather or traffic.</p>
