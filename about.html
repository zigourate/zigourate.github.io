		<p style="color:white;text-align:left">Montreal Kindergarten was founded by a husband and wife, Jeff and Min Lehoux. They are a mixed couple and have three children. Jeff is a successful French-Canadian businessman from Quebec City who grew up in a house full of children since her mother was running a home daycare. He saw and experimented what a daycare who genuinely loves and cares about children was all about. That left him many ideas on how to run a care center that not only babysit children but help them grow, learn and become responsible kids. Having then developed many successful businesses, such as the Shi Tang restaurant in downtown Montreal, he now runs a company that specializes in teaching and providing high-end services to the Chinese people across the world.</p>

		<h2 style="margin:22px 0px 0px 12px; color:white ; text-align:left">ABOUT OUR CENTER</h2><br>
		<p style="color:white;text-align:left">Montreal Kindergarten is a 24/7 daycare located in a newly renovated patrimonial complex downtown Montreal. It is a family-owned enterprise founded by a husband and wife, Jeff and Min Lehoux. Unsatisfied with the existing child care options available for their own children, they decided to open Maison Kinder a few years ago. They are now ready to welcome you to their newest daycare, Maison Kinder Montreal.</p>
		
		<img src="images/image12.jpg "alt="front-1" width="340" height="377">
		<p style="color:white;text-align:left">“… a multi-language place where children receive quality care in an environment that is safe, clean, and nurturing, with endless opportunities for learning through discovery;… a place that not only fosters a child’s physical, social, emotional, and intellectual development, but that takes it a step further by teaching the basics of discipline, respect and manners as well; … a place that understands the stress of today’s lifestyle and responds by opening early and staying open late; … a place that is even open weeknights and weekends, so parents can have a night out or a short vacation…!”</p>
		<p style="color:white;text-align:left">The childcare service center is designed to be a home away from home for children where they can laugh, learn, and grow. Your children will gain social skills as they develop academically. Child care safety is also very important at Maison Kinder Montreal, therefore the center has been renovated and updated to make it 100% child safe. Also for child care health and safety, the childcare service center is cleaned carefully every day – throughout the day – to keep your family healthy. Lastly, we give balanced and wholesome meals that help your child stay focused and grow strong.</p>
		<p style="color:white;text-align:left">Everything about Maison Kinder Montreal is set up to promote your child’s success and provide you with confidence and peace of mind. And we offer a 24 hours / 7 days a week care for your convenience since we are there for you!</p>
		<h1 style="color:white;text-align:left">OUR PHILOSOPHY</h1>
		<p style="color:white;text-align:left ; background-color:none">Laugh, learn and grow! At Maison Kinder Montreal, we believe children are born with the wings, educators help them to fly… We believe that during the early years every child is unique and exceptional. We believe that this great individuality mandates that there can never be a universal method for guiding all children the same way. We believe in two methods, the Traditional and the Montessori ones. At Maison Kinder Montreal, we understand that children are at their best when engaged through a variety of learning methods.
