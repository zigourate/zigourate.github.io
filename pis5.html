	<h4>Child Care Tax Credit</h4>
	<p>With Montreal Kindergarten being a fully private childcare service centre, we do not offer $7.00 subsidized space. However, you can take full advantage of the tax credit for childcare expenses if you meet certain basic conditions.To see what the conditions are to claim the refundable tax credit for the 2013 taxation year for childcare expenses,<a href="http://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/citoyen/credits/credit_enfant/conditions.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here</a>.
	 Once the conditions are met, you can get a refund up to 75% of your child care costs. The percentage of reimbursement is made based on your annual household income. To know your percentage of reimbursement, <a href="http://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/citoyen/credits/credit_enfant/versements/bareme.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here</a>. To know the cost/child care expenses once the tax credit has been reimbursed*, </p>

<p>A year-end receipt for tax purposes will be given at the beginning of the New Year for each child who frequented our childcare service center. If a child stops attending the childcare service center during the year, the receipt for child care expenses will be mailed to you also at the beginning of the New Year.</p>
