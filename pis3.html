	<h4>What to Bring</h4>
	<ul>
<li>Diapers / Wipes / Diaper cream</li>
<li>Baby bottle / Sippy cup</li>
<li>Blanket</li>
<li>Smock (or daddy’s shirt!)</li>
<li>Sun hat</li>
<li>Change of clothes (pants, top, socks &amp; underwear)</li>
<li>Indoor and outdoor shoes</li>
</ul>
<p>Books and blankets are always welcome. Toys, however, should be limited to one. We have a good assortment of age/developmentally appropriate toys here at the center for the children to choose from. Personal toys may get broken or lost and we cannot be responsible for such an event. Jealousy and fighting among the children also occur when personal toys are brought in from home. Our rule is: “If you bring it, you share it!”.</p>
<p>Note: Please make sure everything is labelled with the child’s name.</p>
